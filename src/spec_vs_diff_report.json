  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements with comprehensive error logging, privileged role approval flow, and error handling utilities. All requested features are present in the modified files.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added 'sales' role to the privilegedRoles array alongside admin, inventoryManager, and accountant",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest specifically mentions only three privileged roles (admin, inventoryManager, accountant), but the code includes 'sales' as a fourth privileged role requiring approval",
      "evidence": [

    {
      "description": "Created a new utility module for parsing approval and profile save errors with detailed error type categorization",
      "reason": "While REQ-3 requested error logging, the creation of a separate utility file (approvalErrors.ts) with complex error type classification (authorization, missing-profile, rejected, role-restriction, validation, network, unknown) goes beyond the requested logging functionality",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/utils/approvalErrors.ts"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Added sophisticated error type detection logic for various backend scenarios including authorization, missing profile, rejection states, and actor authentication errors",
      "reason": "REQ-3 requested distinguishing between network failures, backend errors, and validation issues, but the implementation adds several additional error categories (authorization, missing-profile, rejected, role-restriction) that were not specified",
