  "summary": "The diff demonstrates comprehensive implementation of all requirements including backend approval request persistence, frontend UserManagementModule display logic, extensive debug logging throughout the approval lifecycle, and role-based access control enforcement. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed with detailed console logging, proper error handling, and access restrictions for secondary admins.",

      "description": "Manual refresh functionality with RefreshCw icon and toast notifications in UserManagementModule",
      "reason": "BuildRequest REQ-2 mentions 'List refreshes automatically or on manual trigger' as acceptance criteria, but does not explicitly request the implementation of a refresh button UI component with toast feedback. The manual refresh capability exceeds the minimum requirement of verifying correct fetching/display.",
