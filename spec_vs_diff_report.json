  "summary": "The diff implements substantial changes across frontend and backend files addressing all five requirements. REQ-1 through REQ-5 have corresponding implementation evidence, but several critical backend acceptance criteria cannot be verified because backend/main.mo is truncated. Key concerns: REQ-4 requires the approvalRequests map to be in stable storage in main.mo, and REQ-5 requires notification creation logic on approve/reject — both depend on main.mo content that is cut off. The migration.mo file is present and addresses upgrade persistence. Frontend changes for REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3 appear complete. REQ-5 notification display in the frontend NotificationsModule is referenced in the file summaries.",

      "requirement": "The approvalRequests map is declared in stable storage in main.mo and approval/rejection mutations update the correct entry.",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo is truncated and does not show the stable variable declarations or the approve/reject mutation implementations. Cannot confirm the approvalRequests map is declared as stable or that mutations update it correctly.",

      "requirement": "Approving a user creates a notification of type 'approval' and rejecting creates a notification of type 'rejection' targeted at that user's principal in the backend.",
      "reason": "The notification creation logic on approve/reject must reside in backend/main.mo, which is truncated. The frontend NotificationsModule is referenced as displaying notifications, but the backend logic that creates approval/rejection notifications cannot be confirmed from the diff.",
